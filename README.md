Easy Rations: quick mod to enable easy crafting of rations due to an unfortunately alpha 6.1 bug.

Craft 20 rations from 1 piece of stone, 20 rations from 1 log, or 10 rations from 1 plank.

1. download the "easyrations" folder and save to your local mods folder
2. run KUTM
3. click 'mods' and enable easyrations
4. you may need to restart KUTM
5. now in-game you should be able to craft easy rations from stone, logs, and planks.  
6. I strongly recommend disabling this mod once the bug is fixed! (it shouldn't cause any issues since this mod only adds new recipes and not any new items)
7. feel free to adjust the quanities of rations to fit your playing style/preferences!

I recommend going into your crafting screen and setting a min number of rations per settler to something like 50 to force your dorfs to make some extra rations, then setting it to something like 20 so if/when your rations all disappear, you can quickly recover before anyone dies.  (I tested this and made it to day 9 without any rations disappearing so hopefully this is working good enough to get us through till the next patch!)

this isn't a perfect solution, but should let you play without worrying about dying!
